        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2018, Brew & Bite started as a small neighborhood coffee shop with a simple mission: 
          to serve exceptional coffee and create a welcoming space for our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we continue to roast our beans in-house, bake fresh pastries daily, and maintain that 
          same commitment to quality and community that started it all.
